# üöÄ WasmWiz Open Source Launch Plan for Botzr

## üìã Executive Summary

This document provides a step-by-step plan to launch WasmWiz as Botzr's first open source project. The plan is designed to be straightforward and manageable, removing complexity while ensuring a professional launch.

**Timeline: 4-6 weeks from start to public launch**

---

## üéØ Phase 1: Pre-Launch Preparation (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Legal & Licensing ‚úÖ
**Priority: CRITICAL**

#### Choose a License
- **Recommended: Apache 2.0** - Business-friendly, allows commercial use, provides patent protection
- **Alternative: MIT** - Simpler, more permissive
- **Action**: Add LICENSE file to repository root

#### Get Legal Approval
- [ ] Review with Botzr legal team/advisor
- [ ] Ensure no proprietary code or secrets in repository
- [ ] Confirm company owns all code contributions
- [ ] Get written approval to open source

### 1.2 Clean Up Repository üßπ
**Priority: HIGH**

#### Remove Sensitive Data
```bash
# Scan for secrets
git secrets --scan-history

# Check for hardcoded credentials
grep -r "password\|secret\|api_key\|token" --exclude-dir=.git

# Remove any internal URLs/domains
grep -r "botzr\|internal\|private" --exclude-dir=.git
```

#### Sanitize History (if needed)
```bash
# Use BFG Repo-Cleaner if secrets found in history
# https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/
```

### 1.3 Branding & Identity üé®
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] Confirm project name (WasmWiz or rebrand?)
- [ ] Create logo/banner (can use free tools like Canva)
- [ ] Decide on tagline: "Enterprise WebAssembly Execution Platform"
- [ ] Reserve social media handles if desired

## üÜò Common Concerns & Solutions

### "What if no one uses it?"
**Solution**: Focus on solving real problems. Share in relevant communities. Quality over quantity.

### "What if we get negative feedback?"
**Solution**: Treat it as free consultation. Most critics want to help. Engage professionally.

### "How much time will it take?"
**Solution**: Start with 2-4 hours/week. Set up automation. Build a contributor community.

### "What if competitors copy our code?"
**Solution**: That's validation! Open source is about ecosystem growth, not exclusivity.

### "How do we maintain quality?"
**Solution**: Automated testing, code review requirements, clear contribution guidelines.
