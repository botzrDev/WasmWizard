   - Action: Run `cargo fmt` before deployment
   - Impact: None (cosmetic only)

2. **Clippy Warnings** (⚠️)
   - 36 minor clippy warnings (naming conventions, unused code)
   - Action: Review and clean up in future iterations
   - Impact: None (code quality improvement)

3. **Cargo Audit Network Timeouts** (⚠️)
   - Some package checks timed out during validation
   - Action: Retry in better network conditions
   - Impact: Low (known advisories documented)

4. **Kubernetes YAML Validation** (⚠️)
