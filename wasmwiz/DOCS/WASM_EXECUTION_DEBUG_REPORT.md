# WasmWiz WASM Execution Engine - Debug Report

**Date:** June 23, 2025  
**Issue Severity:** HIGH - Production Blocking  
**Status:** Active Investigation Required  

## Executive Summary

The WasmWiz WASM execution engine has been successfully updated to use the latest Wasmer 6.0.1 and wasmer-wasix 0.600.1 APIs, resolving all compilation issues. However, a critical runtime panic is preventing the execution of WASM modules. The application compiles cleanly and all supporting infrastructure (database, Redis, rate limiting) is functional, but multipart form parsing triggers a `BorrowMutError` that crashes the server.

## Current Status

### ✅ **Successfully Completed**
- **API Migration**: Updated from older Wasmer APIs to 6.0.1/0.600.1
- **Compilation**: All cargo build errors resolved, clean build achieved
- **Database Integration**: Migrations applied successfully, database connectivity working
- **Redis Integration**: Distributed rate limiting implemented and functional
- **Configuration**: Production-ready config system operational
- **Code Structure**: Cleaned up duplicate code, removed conflicting WASI environment creation

### 🚨 **Critical Issue: Runtime Panic**

#### Error Details
```
thread 'actix-rt|system:0|arbiter:0' panicked at /home/austingreen/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/actix-web-4.10.2/src/request.rs:393:31:
already borrowed: BorrowMutError
```

#### Impact
- Server crashes immediately when receiving WASM execution requests
- Both `/api/execute` and `/api/debug-execute` endpoints affected
- Health endpoints (`/health`, `/readyz`, `/healthz`) remain functional
- Static file serving and web interface unaffected

#### Root Cause Analysis
The panic occurs in actix-web's request handling, specifically when trying to access request data that's already borrowed mutably. This suggests a conflict in how we're handling multipart form data parsing and request extensions.

**Probable causes:**
1. **Multiple Mutable Borrows**: Attempting to access request extensions while multipart payload is being processed
2. **Actix-Web State Management**: Conflict between middleware and handler accessing request data
3. **Multipart Parser Issue**: Possible deadlock or borrowing conflict in form data processing

## Technical Investigation

### Code Changes Made
1. **execute.rs Refactoring**:
   - Removed duplicate WASI environment creation
   - Fixed Wasmer API calls to use proper `.build()` pattern
   - Simplified non-WASI execution to avoid spawn_blocking complications
   - Enhanced error handling and timeout mechanisms

2. **WASI Detection Logic**:
   - Implemented proper module import analysis
   - Added fallback to informative messages for WASI modules (temporary)
   - Enhanced debugging output for module introspection

3. **Import Management**:
   - Removed unused wasmer-wasix imports where not needed
   - Fixed export type access (`.name()` instead of `.0`)
   - Cleaned up lifetime issues in string handling

### Test Results
```bash
# Compilation - ✅ SUCCESS
cargo build
> warning: 6 warnings generated
> Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.81s

# Server Startup - ✅ SUCCESS  
./target/debug/wasmwiz
> Server starts normally, health endpoints responsive

# WASM Execution - ❌ FAILURE
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/execute -F "wasm_file=@path/to/file.wasm"
> curl: (52) Empty reply from server
> Server panic: BorrowMutError
```

### Files Involved
- **Primary**: `src/handlers/execute.rs` (lines 1-676)
- **Supporting**: `src/app.rs` (route configuration)
- **Middleware**: `src/middleware/distributed_rate_limit.rs`
- **Database**: Migrations applied successfully

## Debugging Strategy

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)
1. **Request Lifecycle Analysis**:
   - Add detailed logging around multipart parsing
   - Identify exact point where BorrowMutError occurs
   - Examine middleware stack for conflicting borrows

2. **Minimal Reproduction**:
   - Create simplified endpoint that isolates multipart parsing
   - Test with smallest possible WASM file
   - Verify issue isn't related to specific WASM module types

3. **Actix-Web Integration Review**:
   - Check for middleware ordering issues
   - Verify request extension usage patterns
   - Consider alternative multipart handling approaches

### Medium-Term Solutions (Priority 2)
1. **WASI Execution Implementation**:
   - Complete the WASI environment setup using wasmer-wasix 0.600.1
   - Implement proper I/O pipe management for stdin/stdout capture
   - Add comprehensive timeout and resource limit enforcement

2. **Non-WASI Module Testing**:
   - Validate the simplified execution logic with actual modules
   - Test common WASM use cases (math, string processing, etc.)
   - Ensure proper memory and execution safety

3. **Error Recovery and Monitoring**:
   - Add circuit breaker patterns around WASM execution
   - Implement detailed execution metrics and logging
   - Create fallback responses for execution failures

### Long-Term Improvements (Priority 3)
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile WASM execution performance
   - Optimize module loading and instantiation
   - Implement module caching where appropriate

2. **Advanced WASM Features**:
   - Support for WASM modules with custom imports
   - Multi-threaded WASM execution capabilities
   - Advanced sandboxing and security controls

## Risk Assessment

### Production Impact
- **HIGH**: Core functionality completely broken
- **Users**: Cannot execute any WASM modules
- **Revenue**: All paid execution features non-functional
- **Reputation**: Critical service failure

### Security Implications
- **LOW**: No additional security vulnerabilities introduced
- **Isolation**: Issue contained to execution pipeline
- **Data**: No risk of data corruption or exposure

### Recovery Time Estimate
- **Quick Fix**: 2-4 hours (if simple borrowing issue)
- **Complex Fix**: 1-2 days (if architectural changes needed)
- **Full WASI Implementation**: 3-5 days additional work

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 4 Hours)
1. **Isolate the Panic**: Create minimal test case to reproduce BorrowMutError
2. **Actix-Web Debugging**: Enable actix-web debug logging to trace request lifecycle
3. **Alternative Parsing**: Test different multipart parsing approaches as workaround

### Short-term Strategy (Next 1-2 Days)
1. **Fix Core Issue**: Resolve the BorrowMutError and restore basic functionality
2. **Basic WASI Support**: Implement minimal WASI execution capability
3. **Testing Suite**: Create comprehensive test coverage for all execution paths

### Medium-term Goals (Next Week)
1. **Full WASI Implementation**: Complete wasmer-wasix integration
2. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and optimization
3. **Documentation Update**: Comprehensive API documentation and troubleshooting guides

## Technical Notes for Next Developer

### Key Investigation Points
1. **Line 393 in actix-web/src/request.rs**: This is where the panic occurs, likely in `HttpRequest::extensions()` or similar
2. **Multipart vs Extensions**: Check if we're trying to access request extensions while multipart stream is active
3. **Middleware Order**: Verify that rate limiting and auth middleware aren't conflicting with form parsing

### Useful Debug Commands
```bash
# Enable maximum debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug,actix_web=trace ./target/debug/wasmwiz

# Test with curl verbose output
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/debug-execute -F "wasm_file=@test.wasm"

# Check for memory issues
valgrind --tool=memcheck ./target/debug/wasmwiz

# Profile performance
cargo build --release
perf record ./target/release/wasmwiz
```

### Code Patterns to Investigate
```rust
// Potentially problematic pattern
req.extensions().get::<AuthContext>() // While multipart payload active

// Alternative approaches to consider
let extensions = req.extensions();
drop(payload); // Ensure payload is consumed first
let auth = extensions.get::<AuthContext>();
```

## Conclusion

The WasmWiz application is very close to production readiness. The core infrastructure, security, and configuration systems are robust and well-implemented. The current blocking issue is a specific runtime panic in request handling that can be resolved with focused debugging effort. Once this issue is fixed and basic WASM execution is restored, the application will be ready for production deployment with full monitoring and observability.

The architecture decisions made during this refactoring (Wasmer 6.0.1 migration, Redis integration, enhanced configuration) are sound and will provide a solid foundation for scaling and maintaining the service long-term.
