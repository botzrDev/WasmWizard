- **Missing CI/CD pipeline** (no automated security scanning)
- **WASM execution failures** ("WASI version could not be determined")
- **In-memory rate limiting** (doesn't scale across instances)

**‚úÖ TESTING STATUS:**
- Unit tests for core logic and middleware - ‚úÖ **PASSING**
- Functional tests with real WASM modules - ‚úÖ **PASSING**
- Integration tests for API endpoints - ‚ö†Ô∏è **PASSING but shows WASM issues**
- Security validation tests - ‚úÖ **PASSING**
- Error handling verification tests - ‚úÖ **PASSING**

**üìù CRITICAL NEXT PRIORITIES:**
1. **URGENT:** Fix dependency vulnerabilities (SQLx ‚â•0.8.1, RSA, IDNA updates)
2. **URGENT:** Implement CI/CD pipeline with security scanning
3. **URGENT:** Fix WASI execution issues found in tests
4. **HIGH:** Replace in-memory rate limiting with Redis-based solution
5. **HIGH:** Add monitoring and alerting (Prometheus + Grafana)
6. **MEDIUM:** Implement proper secrets management

**üîß RECENT AUDIT FINDINGS (June 18, 2025):**
- **CRITICAL:** Multiple dependency vulnerabilities found via cargo audit
- **CRITICAL:** Missing CI/CD infrastructure prevents automated security checks
- **HIGH:** WASM execution shows WASI version detection failures in tests
- **MEDIUM:** Rate limiting implementation doesn't scale across multiple instances
- **LOW:** Code quality is good with comprehensive test coverage (40+ tests)

**üéØ PRODUCTION READINESS:** 6.5/10 - **BLOCKED by critical security issues**
- Strong foundation but critical vulnerabilities prevent deployment
- Estimated 4-6 weeks to achieve production readiness
- Focus required on: dependency updates, CI/CD implementation, WASM execution fixes

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION:** 
**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until critical security vulnerabilities are resolved and CI/CD pipeline is implemented with automated security scanning.

**Note:** Despite comprehensive functionality and good test coverage, critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies and missing CI/CD infrastructure make this application unsuitable for production deployment in its current state.
