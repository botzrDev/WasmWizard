```

## Security Monitoring

### Security Metrics to Monitor

```yaml
# Key security metrics
- wasm-wizard_http_requests_total{status="401"}  # Unauthorized attempts
- wasm-wizard_http_requests_total{status="403"}  # Forbidden requests
- wasm-wizard_rate_limit_hits_total              # Rate limit violations
- wasm-wizard_api_key_failures_total             # Invalid API key usage
- wasm-wizard_wasm_execution_failures_total      # WASM security violations
```

### Security Alerts

```yaml
# Critical security alerts
- alert: UnauthorizedAccessSpike
  expr: rate(wasm-wizard_http_requests_total{status="401"}[5m]) > 10
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Spike in unauthorized access attempts"

- alert: PossibleBruteForceAttack
  expr: rate(wasm-wizard_api_key_failures_total[5m]) > 5
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Possible brute force attack on API keys"

- alert: SuspiciousWasmUpload
  expr: rate(wasm-wizard_wasm_uploads_total[1m]) > 10
  for: 30s
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Unusual WASM upload activity"
```

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning

```bash
# Regular security audits
cargo audit                    # Rust dependencies
npm audit                     # Node.js dependencies (if any)
docker scan wasm-wizard:latest    # Container image scanning
```

### Security Updates

```bash
# Keep dependencies updated
cargo update                  # Update Rust dependencies
apt update && apt upgrade     # System packages
docker pull rust:latest      # Base images
```
