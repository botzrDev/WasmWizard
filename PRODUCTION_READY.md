## Before You Deploy

Complete this quick checklist (5-10 minutes):

### Critical (Required)
```bash
# 1. Generate production secrets
cd wasmwiz
./scripts/generate_secrets.sh

# 2. Create production environment file
cp .env.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with your values

# 3. Set up infrastructure
# - PostgreSQL 15+ database
# - Redis 7 cache
# - TLS certificates
# - Firewall rules (allow 80, 443; block 5432, 6379, 8080)

# 4. Deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# 5. Verify
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Recommended
- Run load tests: `./scripts/load_test.sh`
- Test backup procedures
- Configure monitoring alerts
- Review security advisories in [PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md](wasmwiz/PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md)
