- **Medium/Low Severity**: Patched in next scheduled release

## üîÑ Security Process

### Vulnerability Handling Process

1. **Report Received**: Security team acknowledges receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: Vulnerability is assessed for severity and impact
3. **Fix Development**: Security patch is developed and tested
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure with reporter
5. **Release**: Security update is released
6. **Post-Mortem**: Internal review to prevent similar issues

### Disclosure Timeline

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

- **Immediate**: Acknowledge receipt of report

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### Code Security

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Authentication**: Use proper JWT validation and role-based access
- **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls and permissions
- **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated and audit for vulnerabilities
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets or sensitive configuration to version control
- **Logging**: Be careful not to log sensitive information like passwords or tokens

#### Development Security

```rust
// Example: Secure input validation
fn validate_wasm_input(input: &str) -> Result<(), ValidationError> {
    if input.len() > MAX_WASM_SIZE {
        return Err(ValidationError::TooLarge);
    }
    if !is_valid_wasm_format(input) {
        return Err(ValidationError::InvalidFormat);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Testing Security

- **Security Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite
- **Fuzz Testing**: Use fuzzing to discover edge cases
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies

### For Users

#### Deployment Security

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version with security patches
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow the security checklist in `wasmwiz/SECURITY.md`
- **Network Security**: Deploy behind firewalls and use TLS
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring for security events

#### WASM Module Security

- **Trust**: Only execute WASM modules from trusted sources
- **Validation**: Always validate WASM modules before execution
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate memory and execution time limits
- **Sandboxing**: Ensure WASM modules run in properly sandboxed environments

### Configuration Examples

#### Secure Environment Variables

```bash
# Production environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@secure-db.internal:5432/wasmwizard"
export JWT_SECRET="strong-random-secret-key-256-bits"
export REDIS_URL="redis://secure-redis.internal:6379"
export ENVIRONMENT="production"
export LOG_LEVEL="warn"
```

#### Security Headers (nginx example)

```nginx
# Security headers
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'" always;
```
