## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust**: 1.81+ ([Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For running the development environment
- **PostgreSQL**: 15+ (handled by Docker)
- **Redis**: 7+ (handled by Docker)
- **Git**: For version control

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WasmWizard.git
   cd WasmWizard
   ```

2. **Start the Development Environment**
   ```bash
   cd wasm-wizard
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.development .env
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

5. **Build and Run the Application**
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

6. **Verify Setup**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8080
   - Health check: http://localhost:8080/health
   - Metrics: http://localhost:8080/metrics

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with verbose output
cargo test --verbose

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration_tests

# Run tests without output capture
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Contributing Process

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/botzrDev/WasmWizard/issues) page for open tasks
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch from `master`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clear, focused commits
- Follow the [commit message conventions](#commit-message-conventions)
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation if needed

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Reference any related issues
   - Provide a clear description of changes

3. **Code Review Process**:
   - Maintainers will review your PR
   - Address any feedback or requested changes
   - Once approved, your PR will be merged

### Commit Message Conventions

Follow conventional commit format:

```bash
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```bash
feat(auth): add JWT token validation
fix(api): resolve memory leak in WASM execution
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(handlers): add unit tests for error handling
```

## Code Standards

### Rust Best Practices

- **Code Formatting**: Use `cargo fmt` for consistent formatting
- **Linting**: Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs with `///` comments
- **Error Handling**: Use `Result` and `Option` appropriately
- **Performance**: Be mindful of allocations and performance implications

### Code Quality Checks

Before submitting a PR, run these commands:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --check

# Run linter
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run security audit
cargo audit

# Run tests
cargo test --all-features
```

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Required for all new functions and significant changes
- **Integration Tests**: Required for API endpoints and database operations
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high coverage, especially for critical paths
- **Edge Cases**: Test error conditions and edge cases

### Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Authentication**: Use proper JWT validation and role-based access
- **WASM Security**: Respect sandboxing limits and security boundaries
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and audit for vulnerabilities
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets or sensitive configuration

## Issue Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please provide:

1. **Clear Title**: Summarize the issue concisely
2. **Environment**: Rust version, OS, browser (if applicable)
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
5. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
6. **Screenshots/Logs**: If applicable
7. **Additional Context**: Any other relevant information

### Feature Requests

For feature requests, please provide:

1. **Clear Description**: What feature you want and why
2. **Use Case**: How this feature would be used
3. **Alternatives**: Any alternative solutions you've considered
4. **Mockups**: If applicable, provide mockups or examples

### Using Issue Templates

We use GitHub issue templates to ensure consistent reporting. Please use the appropriate template when creating issues:

- **Bug Report**: For reporting bugs and errors
- **Feature Request**: For proposing new features
- **Documentation**: For documentation improvements
- **Security Issue**: For reporting security vulnerabilities (see [Security](#security))

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

1. **Pull latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ```

2. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

3. **Make changes and commit**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

4. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

### Code Review Guidelines

**For Contributors**:
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Explain your implementation decisions
- Update your PR based on review comments
- Mark resolved conversations as resolved

**For Reviewers**:
- Be constructive and respectful
- Explain reasoning for requested changes
- Focus on code quality and maintainability
- Acknowledge good work

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline runs automatically on all PRs:

- **Build**: Compiles the project
- **Test**: Runs all tests
- **Lint**: Checks code quality with Clippy
- **Security**: Runs security audits
- **Format**: Verifies code formatting

All checks must pass before merging.

## Testing

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# All tests
cargo test

# With coverage (requires cargo-tarpaulin)
cargo tarpaulin --out Html

# Integration tests
cargo test --test integration_tests

# Load testing
./scripts/load_test.sh
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Place in the same file as the code being tested
- **Integration Tests**: Place in `tests/` directory
- **Test Naming**: Use descriptive names that explain what is being tested
- **Test Organization**: Group related tests with `#[cfg(test)]` modules

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage. Focus on:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Security boundaries

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss it publicly
3. Email security concerns to: security@wasmwizard.dev
4. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### Security Best Practices

- **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
- **Logging**: Be careful not to log sensitive information

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the [docs/](docs/) directory
- **Issues**: Search existing issues for similar problems
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions
- **Code of Conduct**: Review our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
